Thi is a Web application (SPA) using ReactJS, HTML5, JavaScript, AJAX, REST and JSON with cloud-based backend (Kinvey). The app keeps users that manage flights. Users can register, login, logout, view a page with all public flights, create a flight, edit and delete their own flights, view a detailed page of a flight and view their own flights only. There is an administrator who can do all stuff that registered users can, but with no limitations about own flights - admin can view and edit all flights. Non-registered users can only view login and register pages.
