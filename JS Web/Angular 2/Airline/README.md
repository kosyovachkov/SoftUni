# Project

Thi is a Web application (SPA) using Angular 6, HTML5, JavaScript, AJAX, REST and JSON with cloud-based backend (Kinvey). 

The app keeps users, operators and admins that manage flights. Registered users can register, login, logout, view a page with all public flights and order flight tickets. Operators can register, login, logout, view a page with all public flights, create a flight, edit and delete their own flights, view a detailed page of a flight and view their own flights only. They also can order flight tickets. Administrators can do all stuff that registered users and operators can, but with no limitations about own flights - admin can view and edit all flights. Non-registered users can only view all public flights, login and register pages.
